This project was created using Google's deep learning [Deeplab](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab) research model. DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation, where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g., person, dog, cat and so on) to every pixel in the input image.
